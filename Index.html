        <p>Uptown is in shambles, but as a wise man once said - "when the going gets tough, the tough get going." Slims? Closed. 
        Tavern? Closed. Stella's? Closed. The Fremont?!?!? you guessed it - closed. However, a new player is on the scene. Critics are calling it "The Phantom of Fremont & Lake,"
        "The Phoenix of Slims Past," "The Ghost of Libertine Tower" - No, I'm not talking about Iron Door Pub. I'm talking about Arts & Rec, a new installment in an otherwise broken neighborhood.
